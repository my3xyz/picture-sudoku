        <p>
          1. Just like normal sudoku, the gameplay is to pick an image and put it in a grid but make sure the same image is not already present in the corresponding row and column. <br>
          2. If you picked the wrong image and would like to remove it, click the redo option and then the image you'd like to remove. <br>
          3. When you're done, click I'm done - it will display the time you took to finish if it's right. <br>
          4. If it's wrong, it will ask you to try again. <br>
          5. If you're not able to complete the game, click I give up and try again. Maybe a different order of images will help you. <br>
          6. Must have fun.
